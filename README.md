# Kashmiri News Domain Dataset and Experiments Code

## Overview
This repository contains the **full Kashmiri News Domain Dataset** along with the code for related NLP experiments. The dataset includes 2000+ Kashmiri news snippets annotated with their respective domains. The experiments demonstrate preprocessing, tokenization, and similarity evaluation techniques such as BLEU scores and tokenizer comparisons, aimed at enhancing Kashmiri language processing.

## Features
- **Language**: Kashmiri  
- **Data Type**: News snippets with domain annotations  
- **Applications**:  
  - Domain classification   
  - Text analysis  
  - Tokenization and similarity experiments  

## Dataset Format
The dataset is provided in **XLSX format**, with the following columns:  
- `Kashmiri`: News snippet in Kashmiri  
- `Domain`: Domain classification (e.g., Politics, Sports, Medical, etc.)  

## Experiments
This repository also contains code for experiments on:  
- **Similarity and BLEU score evaluation**  
- **Tokenizer comparisons and analysis** (e.g., ParsBERT, BLOOM, Flan-T5)  
- Fine-tuning and testing models for Kashmiri text classification
